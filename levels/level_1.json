    "Here's a breakdown of the symbols used in the levels for level designer. Levels can be from 3x3 to 9x9, also in non square forms. most interesting levels are bigger ones.",
    "S: Starting point for player of the level.",
    ". (Dot): Free space where the player can move.",
    "H: Hole on the floor, a tile the player should avoid.",
    "M: Monster, randomly moves only on Free space tiles, kills player, if touched. Usually not scary if alone - low chances to touch.",
    "F: Monster, randomly moves only on Free space tiles, kills player, if touched, that after death (can die only if bomb is taken) leaves a drop - Key for a closed goal gate",
    "B: Bomb, if taken is Killing all the monsters on scene. Good for killing F-mosnter, that can leave key for opening the gate, or for killing multiple M monsters.",
    "U: Unstable tile, a tile that disappears and transforms to hole after the player steps on it once.",
    "D: Mushroom tile, that if collected, temporarily alters player's control, until player drinks a potion. Level must have a potion, if there is a mushroom tile.",
    "P: Potion, restores the player's normal state in case, if mushroom was accidentally eaten",
    "K: Key, an item that can be collected to unlock paths closed gates",
    "C: Closed goal gate - is transofmed to G (Goal gate) when unlocked. that must be unlocked by the Key by getting the key - the only way to exit level. Better placed on the top line somewhere. No sense of using it, if there is a opened gate, or there is no key. Maybe can be used as design to show, that there are alternative exists, that are closed now.",
    "G: Goal - Gate of the level, where the player must reach to complete the level. Better placed on the top line somewhere. Not much sense to have it, if there is a closed gate and key on level."
